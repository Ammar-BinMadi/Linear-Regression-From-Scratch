# Linear-Regression-from-scratch

In this repository you can find linear regression written in numpy from scratch, with some theory explanation and methamatical background connected to this subject and some intuitions related to it. It's one of the most basic problems in machine learning. According to some data and target points, we are creating a line with which we are going to predict new values.
